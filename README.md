# Course project

## This is my course project for programming technician degree in Riga State Technical school

This project is some kind of a internet store for car detailing services. Project consists of plain HTML/CSS with MySQL database, plain PHP for basic logic and plain JavaScript for some interactive parts. Before I started this projetct I had no experience and minimal knowledge in any of these technologies so it became my playground in my attempt to learn how to code.
